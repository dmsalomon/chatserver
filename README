Chatserver
==========

Running the server: ./server [port]
Nothing special it can take an optional port number to bind on. By default
the port is 2000.

Running the client: ./client username [host] [port]
Takes a mandatory username (maximum 31 characters). The host and port are
optional, and they default to localhost (127.0.0.1) and port 2000.

One connected, the client should receive a greeting from the server.
The client can then send and receive messages. To quit, either send EOF
with control-D, or send the message "/q".
